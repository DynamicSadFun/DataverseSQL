/*
This SQL query is used to verify the presence of specific Power Pages Web API endpoints 
in the mspp_sitesetting table. It groups entries by their base API path 
(e.g., Webapi/mserp_vrmpendingvendorinvoicecreateentity) and checks whether each base path 
has the /enabled and /fields settings defined. The result shows a 1 if the setting exists, 
or 0 if it doesn't â€” helping to quickly validate Web API configuration completeness for Power Pages.
